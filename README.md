I was reminded of Daniel Terhorst-North's advice to design software that fits in your head when watching this talk, which led me to further realizations about the value of boring and simplicity in other domains. The Team Topologies book is good, too.

J. Paul Reed is a wonderful human who's done amazing work in this space, and if you like things in this talk it's likely they were inspired at least in part by him.

Why PD is still using "postmortem" in 2021 I can barely fathom, I never really liked that language. SEO makes us do weird things I guess. Put it in an invisible footer or something, y'all.

Reviewing this for the first time in a while, I realize how much this article rang true with me. When I was writing about the disproportionate impact of this work on folks who hold less privilege, I'm only echoing what was written here years earlier.

I could credit more than this particular article, but when thinking about this talk I've come back to this article more than the rest. 

## books

- Accelerate

Accelerate should be required reading for anyone building or operating technology services. The concepts discussed within are foundational to the practice of modern service delivery.

- Modern System Administration
  - Jennifer Davis, 
  - https://www.oreilly.com/library/view/modern-system-administration/9781492055204/

It might not be fair that I'm adding this when it hasn't been finished yet and I haven't read what's up on O'Reilly preview, but I am certain that I recommend it and that there will be relevant and useful information in there.
